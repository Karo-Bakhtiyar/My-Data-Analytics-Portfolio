# Conclusion:
# Most users are moderately engaged, logging at least one type of data regularly.
# A small group shows low engagement, logging very little and potentially at risk of churn.
# Bellabeat should focus on re-engaging low-engaged users through onboarding nudges, 
# simplified tracking, and habit-building features, while also encouraging moderate users 
# to become highly engaged.
