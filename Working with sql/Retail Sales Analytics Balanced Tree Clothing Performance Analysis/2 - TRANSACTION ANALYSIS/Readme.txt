Transaction Analysis

This part of the project dives deeper into customer purchasing behavior by analyzing transaction-level data. Instead of just looking at overall totals, it focuses on how customers shop and what patterns emerge from individual purchases.

Key goals:

Explore unique transaction patterns across the dataset

Compare member vs non-member behavior (frequency, revenue contribution, discounts used)

Use percentile and distribution analysis to see how revenue is spread across customers

Highlight which segments of customers drive the majority of sales

Why it matters:
Transaction analysis helps Balanced Tree Clothing Co. understand who their customers are and how they buy. These insights are crucial for tailoring loyalty programs, optimizing discount strategies, and improving customer retention. It shifts the focus from raw revenue totals to customer-centric metrics that support smarter marketing and membership strategies.
