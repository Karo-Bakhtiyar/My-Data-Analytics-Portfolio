Product Analysis

This part of the project focuses on understanding which products and categories drive performance for Balanced Tree Clothing Co. It breaks down revenue and sales across the product catalog to uncover trends in customer preferences.

Key goals:

Identify top revenue-generating products by category, segment, and style

Measure product penetration rates (how often a product appears in transactions)

Analyze cross-selling patterns by looking at which products are commonly purchased together

Provide insights to support merchandising, pricing, and inventory management

Why it matters:
Product analysis gives the merchandising and inventory teams actionable insights into what sells best, which products attract repeat purchases, and where cross-selling opportunities exist. This enables smarter stock management, better promotional targeting, and data-driven decisions about product assortment and pricing.
