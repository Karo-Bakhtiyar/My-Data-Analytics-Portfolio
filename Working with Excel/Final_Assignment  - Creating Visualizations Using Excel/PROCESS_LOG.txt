# Car Sales Data Visualization PROCESS LOG

> **Note:**  
> This process log documents, step-by-step, how I transformed a ready-to-use car sales dataset into a set of clear, insightful visualizations.  
> Since the dataset and summary tables were already prepared, my work focused entirely on selecting the right visual formats, building them in the tool, and ensuring they communicated the data effectively.  
>  
> By keeping this log, I provide transparency in my visualization choices, allow others to replicate the process, and maintain a personal reference for future projects where similar workflows are required.

## Visualization Phase: (Data Presentation)

This phase focused on creating multiple charts and dashboards from the provided dataset and pivot tables, ensuring each visual addressed a specific analytical question.

### Steps Taken

- **Opened Dataset in Visualization Tool**  
  Imported the provided Excel workbook.

- **Reviewed All Sheets**  
  Examined `CarSales`, `Sheet1`, `Sheet2`, `Sheet3`, and `Sheet4` to understand the available summaries and raw data.

- **Chart 1 – Total Quantity Sold by Dealer ID** *(from Sheet1)*  
  - Created a **horizontal bar chart** to compare total quantity sold across dealers.  
  - **Y-axis:** Dealer ID  
  - **X-axis:** Sum of Quantity Sold  
  - Bar lengths make it easy to visually rank dealers by sales volume.  
  - Added data labels to each bar for exact values, improving clarity.

- **Chart 2 – Monthly Profit by Model** *(from Sheet2)*  
  - Created a **multi-series line chart** to show profit trends over time for each model.  
  - **X-axis:** Date (months)  
  - **Y-axis:** Sum of Profit  
  - Each line represents a different model (Beaufort, Champlain, Hudson, Labrador, Salish).  
  - This format highlights fluctuations and seasonal patterns more effectively than a column chart.  
  - Added a legend for clarity and formatted the date axis for readability.

- **Chart 3 – Annual Profit by Dealer ID** *(from Sheet3)*  
  - Created a **clustered column chart** to compare total profit across dealers for each year.  
  - **X-axis:** Dealer ID (grouped by Year)  
  - **Y-axis:** Sum of Profit  
  - Used a single, bold color for all bars to emphasize magnitude without distraction.  
  - Grouping by year allowed quick visual comparison of dealer performance between 2018 and 2019.

- **Chart 4 – Profit by Model and Dealer ID** *(from Sheet4)*  
  - Used a **line chart** to visualize profit trends for each model across different dealer IDs.  
  - **X-axis:** Dealer ID  
  - **Y-axis:** Profit  
  - Each line represented a different model, allowing comparison of performance patterns.

- **Formatted All Visuals**  
  - Applied consistent font and color themes across all charts.  
  - Added descriptive titles to make each chart self-explanatory.  
  - Ensured gridlines, legends, and labels were clear without cluttering visuals.

- **Created Dashboard Layout**  
  - Arranged charts logically: overall sales first, then breakdowns by time, dealer, and model.  
  - Used alignment tools for even spacing.  
  - Finalized design for presentation and analysis.
