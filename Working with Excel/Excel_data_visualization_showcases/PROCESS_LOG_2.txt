# Car Sales Data Visualization – Process Log for Part 2

This continuation builds on the visual work completed in Part 1 of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate (Hands-on Lab).  
The dataset remained pre-cleaned and ready for use.  
The focus in Part 2 was to expand the portfolio with **advanced Excel visualizations**, including multi-dimensional and interactive charts.  
**All visualizations were created by me**, using the same master dataset and guided lab instructions.

> **Note:**  
> This process log is a detailed, step-by-step record of how I approached, cleaned, and prepared the dataset.  
> I created it not only to ensure accountability and transparency, but also so anyone could replicate my workflow or verify my results.  
>   
> By documenting each decision and action, I can clearly demonstrate my analytical thinking, technical skills, and attention to detail — key qualities for any data analyst.  
>   
> Beyond this specific project, maintaining thorough logs helps me track progress, confirm that no critical steps are missed, and continuously refine my approach for future projects.  
> It also serves as a valuable reference and training tool, both for myself and for others collaborating on similar workflows.
