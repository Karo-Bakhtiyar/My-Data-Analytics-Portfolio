# Car Sales Data Visualization – Process Log for Part 3

This section continues the visualization work from Parts 1 and 2 of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate (Hands-on Lab).  
The goal in Part 3 was to explore **diverse Excel chart types** and build a **dashboard** that communicates insights clearly to stakeholders.  
**All visualizations were created by me**, using the same master dataset and guided lab instructions.

> **Note:**  
> This process log is a detailed, step-by-step record of how I approached, cleaned, and prepared the dataset.  
> I created it not only to ensure accountability and transparency, but also so anyone could replicate my workflow or verify my results.  
>   
> By documenting each decision and action, I can clearly demonstrate my analytical thinking, technical skills, and attention to detail — key qualities for any data analyst.  
>   
> Beyond this specific project, maintaining thorough logs helps me track progress, confirm that no critical steps are missed, and continuously refine my approach for future projects.  
> It also serves as a valuable reference and training tool, both for myself and for others collaborating on similar workflows.

## 11. Bar Chart  
**Process Steps:**  
- Used horizontal layout to display categories with longer labels (e.g., car models).  
- Inserted a bar chart to visualize metrics like unit sales or resale value.  
- Adjusted axis orientation and label formatting for readability.

## 12. Pie Chart  
**Process Steps:**  
- Chose proportional data such as vehicle type distribution.  
- Created a pie chart to show share of total.  
- Added data labels and legend for interpretability.

## 13. Sunburst Chart  
**Process Steps:**  
- Used hierarchical data (e.g., region → country → brand).  
- Inserted a sunburst chart to visualize nested relationships.  
- Customized segment colors and labels to enhance readability.

## 14. Dashboard  
**Process Steps:**  
- Integrated multiple charts (column, bar, pie, sunburst) into a single dashboard tab.  
- Used slicers to enable dynamic filtering by category (e.g., brand, region, vehicle type).  
- Applied cell linking and layout formatting for seamless interactivity.  
- Designed the dashboard for stakeholder clarity and visual impact.
