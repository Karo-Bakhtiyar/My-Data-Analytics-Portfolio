## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate – Excel course hands-on lab series**.  
It showcases the complete workflow of visualizing a structured dataset using **Microsoft Excel**, with a focus on stakeholder-ready communication.

The dataset contains car sales records across various regions, brands, and vehicle types.  
I approached the task as a real-world data visualization challenge, focusing on:

* Selecting appropriate chart types for different data relationships  
* Designing clear, professional visuals for non-technical audiences  
* Building an interactive dashboard for dynamic exploration  
* Documenting each step for transparency and reproducibility

This documentation serves as both a **process log** and a **portfolio showcase**.

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel** – Chart creation, dashboard design, and interactivity  
* **Excel Features** – Column Chart, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Sunburst Chart, Slicers, Dashboard Layout
