## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate – Excel course final exam/test**.
It demonstrates the complete workflow of cleaning, structuring, and preparing a dataset for analysis using **Microsoft Excel**.
The dataset contains records of fleet equipment for various departments within Montgomery.

I approached the task as a real-world data analytics exercise, focusing on:

* Identifying and resolving data quality issues
* Creating a clean, structured dataset
* Preparing analysis-ready tables and pivot tables
* Documenting each step for transparency and reproducibility

This documentation is intended as both a **process log** and a **portfolio showcase**.
