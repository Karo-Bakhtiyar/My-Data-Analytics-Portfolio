## Cleaning Phase: (Part 1 – Data Preparation)

This phase focused on transforming raw fleet equipment data into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis.

### Steps Taken

- **Initial Examination**  
  Opened the Excel file and reviewed its structure. Identified issues including blank rows, duplicate entries, spelling errors, and inconsistent formatting.

- **Removed Blank Rows**  
  Used the Filter feature to locate and delete all empty rows. Final dataset contains **53 rows of data** (plus header).

- **Removed Duplicates**  
  Applied the Remove Duplicates feature to eliminate repeated records.

- **Corrected Spelling Errors**  
  Manually reviewed and fixed all spelling mistakes across the dataset.

- **Removed Double Spaces**  
  Used Find and Replace to clean up all double-spacing issues.

- **Simplified Department Names**  
  Used Flash Fill to consolidate department names into a single column. Removed unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.

- **Adjusted Column Widths**  
  Widened all columns to ensure full visibility of data entries.

## Structuring Phase: (Part 2 – Analysis Preparation)

This phase focused on formatting and organizing the cleaned data to make it ready for future analysis.

### Steps Taken

- **Formatted as Table**  
  Converted the dataset into a formal Excel table using *Format as Table* for easier filtering and sorting.

- **Calculated Summary Statistics (AutoSum)** for the `Equipment Count` column:  
  - **SUM:** 1582  
  - **AVERAGE:** 32.29  
  - **MIN:** 1  
  - **MAX:** 379  
  - **COUNT:** 49

- **Created Pivot Table 1**  
  - Rows: Department  
  - Values: Sum of Equipment Count  
  - Sorted in descending order by equipment count.

- **Duplicated Pivot Table**  
  Created two additional identical pivot tables across separate worksheets for flexible future analysis.

- **Pivot Table 2: Department → Equipment Class**  
  - Added `Equipment Class` below `Department`  
  - Collapsed all fields except *Transportation*.

- **Pivot Table 3: Equipment Class → Department**  
  - Added `Equipment Class` above `Department`  
  - Collapsed all fields except *CUV*.
