# Cognos Analytics Visualization Showcases

This folder contains visualizations I created using **IBM Cognos Analytics** as part of the *IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate* program.  

Unlike my Excel visualizations, these dashboards cannot be shared interactively because:
- Cognos Analytics requires a **paid subscription** and **company/organization account** for public sharing.
- The export options are limited, so I saved them as a **OneNote file** for offline viewing.

These visualizations are **entirely my own work**, produced using the skills I was taught in the IBM course, including:
- Data calculations
- Chart and dashboard design
- Analytical storytelling using Cognos' built-in tools

> **Note:** Since the dashboards are static exports, they cannot display the same interactivity as the original Cognos environment.
