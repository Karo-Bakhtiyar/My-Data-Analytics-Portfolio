# Predictive Modeling with Python – Car Prices

## Overview
This project explores predictive modeling techniques to estimate car prices using Python. 
It demonstrates how data analysis, linear regression, multiple regression, and polynomial regression 
can be applied to build models that explain the variation in car prices.

## Project Objectives
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.
- Apply **Simple Linear Regression** to understand the relationship between a single feature and price.
- Extend to **Multiple Linear Regression** with several features to improve prediction accuracy.
- Explore **Polynomial Regression** to capture non-linear patterns in the data.
- Evaluate models using the **R-squared metric** to measure how well each model explains the variation in car prices.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for regression modeling and evaluation

## Key Results
- Simple Linear Regression explained a smaller portion of the variation in car prices.
- Multiple Linear Regression significantly improved explanatory power (~80.9% variation explained).
- Polynomial Regression further enhanced the model (~67.4% variation explained for certain fits).

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook: `Predictive-Modeling-with-Python–Car-Prices.ipynb`
3. Run the cells step by step to reproduce the results.

## Portfolio Value
This project showcases:
- Hands-on application of machine learning regression techniques.
- Data wrangling and exploratory data analysis skills.
- Model evaluation and comparison with clear interpretation of results.
